There are 𝑛 left boots and 𝑛 right boots. Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings 𝑙 and 𝑟, both of length 𝑛. The character 𝑙𝑖 stands for the color of the 𝑖-th left boot and the character 𝑟𝑖 stands for the color of the 𝑖-th right boot.

A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.

For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').

Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.

Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.

Input
The first line contains 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤150000), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).

The second line contains the string 𝑙 of length 𝑛. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The 𝑖-th character stands for the color of the 𝑖-th left boot.

The third line contains the string 𝑟 of length 𝑛. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The 𝑖-th character stands for the color of the 𝑖-th right boot.

Output
Print 𝑘 — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.

The following 𝑘 lines should contain pairs 𝑎𝑗,𝑏𝑗 (1≤𝑎𝑗,𝑏𝑗≤𝑛). The 𝑗-th of these lines should contain the index 𝑎𝑗 of the left boot in the 𝑗-th pair and index 𝑏𝑗 of the right boot in the 𝑗-th pair. All the numbers 𝑎𝑗 should be distinct (unique), all the numbers 𝑏𝑗 should be distinct (unique).

If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.

HINT:
一种是排序之后找
一种是统计字母的个数，（放在vector里面）
